# !!! STOP, READ CAREFULLY !!!

This repository is simply a docker container with a bash script that starts ism7mqtt, to make it easier to use as a home assistant add-on.
- If you have any problem with sensors, controls, deprecation warnings, ..., this is the wrong place! Please report [here](https://github.com/zivillian/ism7mqtt/issues)
- If you have an issue with the add-on not starting, or configuration options in the HA add-on manager, this is the right place

However, do not expect major changes to this add-on. I do not have a Wolf device any more and therefore have little incentive to work on this. I will try to keep this add-on in sync with new upstream ism7mqtt versions, but that's about it.
